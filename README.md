Find all information you need on how to apply for the VI summer school 2018

## Where & when?
The Coding Summer School starts on __Monday, August 27th to Friday, September 7th__ at Virtual Identity (Isarwinkel 16 in Munich). This is a full-time program, which means you will have to commit for the whole 2 weeks.

## Who is Virtual Identity?
Virtual Identity is a digital service design company. Since 1995, we help our customers to utilize digital technologies. Today we are 200 digital experts working in offices in Freiburg, Munich, Vienna and Porto.

## Why are we doing this?
We are always eager to learn and to improve, and to meet talented people. Therefore it is natural for us to share our knowledge and surely, we will learn from you as well.

## For whom is the program?
The Coding Summer School is created for curious and open-minded college/university students and graduates in computer science (web development, full-stack, frontend and backend development), data science, UX/UI or others with a pronounced affinity to media informatics.

## What does the participation cost?
The summer school itself is for __free__. However, we will be selecting the best candidates as the places are limited. We will provide you a sleeping accomodation in a youth hostel in Munich for the whole time, so you will only have to arrange your own travel to Munich.
